# Shiny-App-Data-Viz
Link to my first Shiny App.

Here's the link: https://ingridbaade.shinyapps.io/app-1/

This data has been used by many people for data visualisations because it is part of Bill Howe's Data At Scale Coursera course. There is a website where one can access loads of Crime data. That's where I got the san Francisco 2017 data. It was very easy to download. 

The Shiny app runs a bit slow; I didn't optimise it because I made a change or two and the code stopped working so I left well enough alone for this first attempt.
